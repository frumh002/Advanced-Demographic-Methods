**1. Approximately 85,000 adolescents turn 16 each year in Wisconsin. Data from Fohr et al., 2005 suggest that the probability of being involved in a non-fatal motor vehicle accident among Wisconsin 16-year-olds is roughly 0.0486. The authors find that the probability declines dramatically with age, reaching 0.0145 by age 30. Assume that, in each year of life, the probability of experiencing a non-fatal motor vehicle accident is equal to 0.062 - 0.000053 x (age2), where age is defined in discrete one-year intervals.**


**Acquire an account with the Human Mortality Database and the Human Fertility Database. Use the HMDHFDplus package in R to obtain the 2005 single year age-specific death probabilities from the Human Mortality Database. Answer the following questions:**

```{r hmd}
#| echo: true

# Used the following code to get the data

# blt <- readHMDweb(
#   CNTRY = "USA",
#   item = "bltper_1x1",
#   username = "frumh002@umn.edu"
# ) |>
#   filter(Year == 2005) |>
#   rename(
#     year = Year,
#     age = Age
#   ) |>
#   select(-OpenInterval) |>
#   mutate(
#     age = as.numeric(age)
#   )

df <- blt |>
  filter(age >= 16, age <= 31) |>
  mutate(
    nqxi = 0.062 - (0.000053 * (age^2)),
    new_px = 1 - (nqxi + qx),
    new_lx = accumulate(new_px, `*`, .init = 85000)[-1],
    new_lx = lag(new_lx, default = 85000),
    ndxi = nqxi * new_lx,
    npxi = 1 - nqxi,
    dx = qx * new_lx,
    lxi = accumulate(npxi, `*`, .init = 100000)[-1],
    lxi = lag(lxi, default = 100000)
  )

```

**a) What proportion of Wisconsinites who live to age 16 will live to age 31 without experiencing a motor vehicle accident?**

Of those who survived to age 16, 59.6% will live to age 31 without experiencing a motor vehicle accident.

```{r acc_1}
#| echo: true

# The new_lx calculates the number of people who are still alive
# and haven't yet experienced a motor vehicle accident
df$new_lx[df$age == 31] / df$new_lx[df$age == 16]


```

**b) Among those who live to age 25 accident-free, what is the probability of experiencing an accident by age 31?**

Of those who lived to age 25 accident-free, 12.4% will experience a motor vehicle accident by age 31.

```{r acc_2}
#| echo: true

# The lxi calculates the number of people who have not experienced
# motor vehicle accident yet
# The new_lx calculates the number of people who are still alive
# and haven't yet experienced a motor vehicle accident
1 - (df$lxi[df$age == 31] / df$lxi[df$age == 25])


```

**c) Among those who survive to age 16, what is the probability of dying without experiencing an accident by age 31?**

Of those who survived to age 16, 1.02% will die by age 31 without experiencing a motor vehicle accident.

```{r acc_3}
#| echo: true

num <- df |>
  filter(age != 31) |>
  summarise(sum = sum(dx)) |>
  pull()

num / 85000

```

**d) If the experience of accidents and the probability of dying are process-dependent, is your estimate for C an overestimate or an underestimate of the true probability?**

The probability of folks in accidents is inversely correlated with overall death rate. Given a certain death rate from any cause, the proportion of folks in accidents will be lower the higher the death rate from other causes.
